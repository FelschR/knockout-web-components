# knockout-web-components
A bridge to be able to use web components with knockout.js

This project provides a custom bindingHandler to integrate web components into knockout applications more seamlessly.
It's compatible with standard web components and thus also allows integration of components from projects like [stencil](http://stenciljs.com).

**Attention**  
Currently this repository is empty.
I have yet to generalise the source code for this a bit and then I'll push the source code and documentation.
